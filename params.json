They will apply basic concepts related to plant physiology and programming to develop a choice of three systems.  All three combine the use of Python, Arduino Unos, Rasperry Pi 3's, and a potted plant.  The three systems either use an Arduino to sense soil moisture, sense light levels, or both.  The Raspberry Pi displays the moisture readings on its screen, and may send messages to the students when plant watering is needed, if time permits.\r\n",
